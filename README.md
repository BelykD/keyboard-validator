Keyboard Validator program was created using a C# Windows Form App. The purpose of the program is to test every key switch on a full-size keyboard. All key outputs are printed to a text box that can be reset by hitting the reset button. To test keypad keys you must enable Num Lock. Duplicate keys will display both keys at the same time (Ctrl, Shift Alt, Enter) so it is important to test both.
